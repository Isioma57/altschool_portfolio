| 1     | Setting up a private repository            | Established a private repository and added the instructor as a collaborator, thereby enabling seamless communication and version control for project development.                                                                                                                                             | [Isioma Joy Ugbekile](https://github.com/Isioma57)                  |
| 2     | Dockerized PostgreSQL Setup & Python Database Interaction                             | Configured a PostgreSQL server using Docker and Docker Compose, enabling efficient management and deployment. Additionally, loaded data and implemented Python database interaction utilizing psycopg2.                                                                             | [Isioma Joy Ugbekile](https://github.com/Isioma57)          |
| 3     | Interact with GCS and Bigquery from python                            | This project enables users to interact with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and BigQuery from Python, following the DRY principle for extensibility and reusability. It allows users to load CSV files from their local machine into BigQuery and fetch data from APIs to store in GCS and BigQuery.                                                                           | [Isioma Joy Ugbekile](https://github.com/Isioma57)          |
